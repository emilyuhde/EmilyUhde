					<p>It's November, which means that it is time for benefits enrollment for 2015 at my job. I very excitedly logged into my benefits account on Saturday morning (November 1st) and got to work on optimizing my choices for next year. The list of benefits that Microsoft offers employees is extensive and I'm happy to make the most of them. Though I don't have any hard numbers on this, I imagine that benefits enrolment time for most people is somewhat of a hassle, if they even re-evaluate their options at all. On the other hand, I love micromanaging my finances, and I even love doing my taxes, so benefits enrollment is like having Christmas a month early. Job benefits vary greatly country to country, so the ones I list below may only be helpful to know about for people in the United States.</p>
				  
					<h3>Health Savings Account (HSA)</h3>
					<p>I max this account out every year because it would be dumb not to. The legal maximum contribution is $3,350 per year (2014 max) and Microsoft contributes $1,000 of that. There are so many benefits to this account that I will likely write a post going into more details later, but here is the quick version: HSAs are savings accounts that you can use to pay for medical expenses. You can use the money in the account right away when things happen, or you can reimburse yourself later on. For our HSAs, there is even an option to log and store receipts on the account so you can reimburse yourself at any time in the future when you need the money. All money in the account earns interest and you have the option to invest the money as well.</p>
					
					<p>The money you put in is not taxed and it is also not taxed when you withdraw the money. Additionally, your earnings are not taxed either. When you hit 65, the account will automatically turn into a Roth IRA and you can withdraw the money for non-health care expenses at that time. This is the ultimate retirement account! If you're not enrolled in your company's HSA plan you need to go do it right now!</p>

					<p>I also decided that this year instead of maxing it out with payroll contributions from each pay check, I am going to front load the account and have the entire year's maximum withdrawn from my first pay check of the year. This way I can invest the money immediately and enjoy knowing that I'll be earning money on the entire balance starting at the beginning of the year.</p>
				  
					<h3>Flexible Spending Account</h3>
					<p>This year I enrolled in the FSA that is offered because I intend to use my HSA as a retirement account, not actually for health care expenses. Since I have an HSA, I can only enroll in a FSA to be used for vision and dental expenses. Since I usually end up spending at least a couple hundred dollars on those things every year, it makes sense to sign up for this account to get a tax break on the money I put in it that I will inevitably spend at the dentist and optometrist.</p>
				  
					<h3>401(k) Retirement Account</h3>
					<p>I could write a novel about 401(k) accounts, but for this post I'll keep things pithy. I max this account out every year, contributing the legal maximum of $17,500 for someone my age (2014 max). The tax savings from not having to pay income tax on that money is huge! I also invest my 401(k) money in a mix of low fee Vanguard index funds that are offered through the Microsoft plan. Year to date, I've had a 7.23% return on investment. Not bad!</p>
				  
					<h3>Life Insurance, Disability Insurance, Accidental Dismemberment Insurance (seriously), etc.</h3>
					<p>I waived coverage for all of these insurances (there are about five different kinds that are offered), except for the minimum life insurance policy that Microsoft now requires and pays for for employees. I don't have any dependents who rely on my income to survive, except my cat, so if I were to pass away there is no one who would miss my income. I decided it was better to save the money each pay check and invest it instead of spending it on this sort of insurance.</p>
				  
					<h3>Stay Fit</h3>
					<p>Microsoft offers employees a program called Stay Fit that will either pay for a gym membership, give you $800 of funds to spend on health and fitness related expenses (bicycle, yoga classes, basketball hoop, etc.), or you can just get $200 which I call the Stay Fat option. Last year I chose a membership at "The Microsoft Gym", which is not really owned by Microsoft but it is right by the Redmond campus and probably 99% of members are employees of Microsoft. I haven't used it very much this year, and since I'm taxed on the membership fees as earned income, I decided to skip the gym next year and take the $800 reimbursement option and pick up some nice weights I can use at home for years and years.</p>
					
					<p>This isn't a complete list of benefits that are offered but these are the ones I wanted to highlight as they are some of my favorites and ones some people might not think to take the most advantage of. Based on taking full advantage of the HSA, 401(k) and FSA, I'm avoiding paying taxes on over $20,000 of my income ever year. For the highest earners, this would save over $7,900 per year on their tax bills in 2015!</p><br /><br /><br />
